Hospital Automation

In a hospital, there are 20 doctors and 50 nurses. Only doctors with an operator role can participate in surgeries, while all nurses can participate. Each surgery must have at least one doctor, and at most 5 nurses can participate in a surgery. Patients can undergo surgery once a year and can have a maximum of 3 check-ups per month.

Based on this information, answer the following questions:

Who is the patient with the most check-ups in a year?
What is the highest cost incurred in a surgery?
Surgery cost = (number of surgery items x item price) + doctor fee
